The purpose of this Webpack Starter is to allow people to create websites without any framework/library like React, Angular, Vue but only using simple but powerful technologies to build quality websites.

With this starter you can have clean URLs by removing the .html extension. For example:

- *website.com/contact*
- *website.com/blog*
- *website.com/profile*

## Technologies used

- Templating: `Pug`
- Styling: `Sass` *you can also use stylus*
- Scripting: `jQuery or VanillaJS(plain Javascript)`
- JS Compiler: `Babel ES6 ES7 ES8 ES9 ES10 ES11 ES12` (that means you can use async/await, replaceAll, optional chaining... among many others)


## Features

- Well organized folder structure for views, styles, and assets.
- Webpack notifier on every compilation.
- Compatibility with `manifest`, `browserconfig`, and other external files you wish to include.
